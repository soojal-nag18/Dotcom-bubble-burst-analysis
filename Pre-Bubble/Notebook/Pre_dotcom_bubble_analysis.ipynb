    "## üìå Pre-Dotcom Bubble Era ‚Äî Key Highlights (1990‚Äì1995)\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è. **Early Internet Adoption**\n",
    "The World Wide Web became publicly accessible in the early 1990s, with the first user-friendly web browser (*Mosaic*, 1993) making it easier for non-technical users to access the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è. **Growth of Tech Infrastructure**\n",
    "Personal computers, dial-up internet connections, and networking hardware expanded rapidly. Companies like Intel and Microsoft were dominant players laying the technological groundwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è. **Rise of Venture Capital Interest**\n",
    "Investors began funding small internet-related startups with new ideas. While early-stage funding existed, it was modest compared to the explosive venture capital surge of the late 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "4Ô∏è. **NASDAQ‚Äôs Steady Performance**\n",
    "The NASDAQ Composite Index, which includes many technology companies, showed consistent growth. Large established tech companies like Microsoft and Intel drove most of this performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5Ô∏è. **Limited Public Awareness**\n",
    "Most of the general public was still unfamiliar with the Internet. E-commerce had not yet taken off.\n",
    "\n",
    "6Ô∏è. **Netscape IPO ‚Äî The Spark (1995)**\n",
    "Netscape‚Äôs initial public offering in August 1995 is often cited as the moment the Dotcom era truly ignited. Its stock famously doubled on the first day of trading, showcasing massive investor appetite for internet companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "7Ô∏è. **Economic Backdrop**\n",
    "A stable macroeconomic environment with low interest rates provided ample capital for investments. Optimism about the ‚ÄúInformation Age‚Äù fueled belief in the transformative power of internet technology.\n",

    "## üìä Why Use NASDAQ Composite Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **NASDAQ Composite Index** is the ideal benchmark for studying the Dotcom Bubble era for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è. **Technology-Focused**\n",
    "NASDAQ has historically listed a large number of technology and internet companies. During the 1990s, it was home to most of the rapidly growing startups that fueled the Dotcom boom.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è. **Captures Investor Sentiment**\n",
    "The index reflects how investor confidence in technology stocks evolved before, during, and after the bubble. Its dramatic rise and fall mirror the speculative mania and subsequent collapse of the internet sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è. **Representative of the Era**\n",
    "Companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and later Amazon and Yahoo were major NASDAQ listings that became symbols of the Dotcom era. Tracking the index captures the collective impact of these companies on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "4Ô∏è. **Public and Reliable Data**\n",
    "NASDAQ Composite data is widely available, reliable, and free to use for analysis and education. It provides a clear time series of historical market trends without licensing complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5Ô∏è. **Clear Trends for Analysis**\n",
    "The NASDAQ‚Äôs performance from the early 1990s through the early 2000s makes it easy to visualize:\n",
    "- The steady growth in the **pre-bubble** era.\n",
    "- The rapid surge **during the bubble**.\n",
    "- The sharp decline **after the burst**."
